# Fyralis Ingestion — Implementation Plan

**Canonical reference:** `00-system-design.md` is the source of truth for architectural intent and non-negotiables N1–N5. Every milestone below names which non-negotiables it discharges. **A milestone cannot be cut in scope below the point where one of its named non-negotiables is no longer satisfied.** This is the test for "is this trim acceptable?"

**Scope:** Sequenced migration from the current forward-only webhook/poller code (Phase 1 state) to the Temporal + Kafka + S3 + Redis backfill architecture specified in `02-high-level-design.md` v2.1 and `03-low-level-design.md` v3.1.

**Read first:** this plan assumes familiarity with the canonical doc (00), HLD (02), and LLD (03). It does not re-explain architecture; it sequences the work, names what blocks what, and identifies the tests that gate each milestone.

**Status of this plan:** the milestones are ordered by hard dependency (substrate before workflows; workflows before cutover; cutover before backfill). The effort estimates (S/M/L) are eyeball numbers, not story points — they communicate relative cost, not absolute schedule. Phase 4 implementation will reveal sequencing decisions that need revision; this plan should be re-validated at the start of each milestone.

*Coherence audit (v4.1 amendment): each milestone now declares which N1–N5 non-negotiables it discharges. This makes scope-cuts auditable against `00-system-design.md` §2.*

## 2. Sequenced milestones

Six milestones. Each has a gate; no milestone starts until the previous one's gate passes. Within a milestone, parallelisation is encouraged; the gate is the integration point.

### M1 — Foundational substrate

**Discharges non-negotiables:** none directly (foundational substrate). Enables all subsequent N1–N5 work; M1 is the gate without which no later milestone can deliver an N.

**Outcome:** all infra is provisioned, all new tables exist, the pgbouncer + statement_cache_size change ships, and a no-op normalizer/writer process pair runs against an empty Kafka topic without errors. Zero user-visible behavior change.

**Changes:**
- DDL migrations 0045 (onboarding_runs + onboarding_shards), 0046 (ingestion_failures), 0047 (onboarding_triggers), 0048 (gateway_session_state), 0049 (entity_aliases_normalized_idx CONCURRENTLY), 0050 (tenant_flags).
- Infra: Temporal Cloud namespace OR self-hosted Temporal cluster (decision per §6 Q2); Kafka cluster (3 brokers, topics created with config from LLD §10 and §11.3); S3 bucket with lifecycle rules; Redis (single instance for v1); pgbouncer (sidecar vs centralised per §6 Q1).
- `lib/shared/db.py` — `statement_cache_size=0` added to `create_pool`, DSN switched to pgbouncer endpoint.
- `pyproject.toml` — add `temporalio`, `confluent-kafka`, `aiokafka`, `aioboto3`, `redis`, `orjson`, `opentelemetry-*`.
- `services/ingestion/{normalizer,writers,raw_tier,rate_limit,progress,idempotency,feature_flags,workflows,activities,planners,reconciler}/__init__.py` — package skeletons.
- `services/ingestion/rate_limit/scripts/acquire.lua` + `report_retry_after.lua` + Python client.

**Tests that must pass:**
- `test_pool_pgbouncer_compatibility`: assert asyncpg pool works against pgbouncer with `statement_cache_size=0`; assert prepared-statement-required queries fail loudly (no silent regression).
- `test_redis_lua_acquire_and_refill`: full sequence of acquire/sleep/acquire; assert token refill math; assert lockout from `report_retry_after`.
- `test_s3_put_if_absent_idempotent`: PUT same content hash twice; second is no-op (412 PreconditionFailed handled).
- `test_kafka_producer_idempotent`: produce same message twice from same producer session; assert single broker copy via offset count.
- `test_migration_0045_to_0050_apply_and_rollback`: forward + backward migration on a clean DB.
- `test_functional_index_used_in_explain`: assert `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)` for the batched alias query shows `Index Scan using entity_aliases_normalized_idx`.

**Risk if deferred:** everything downstream blocks. M1 is the hardest milestone to compress; underestimate at peril.

**Risk of running out of order:** none; M1 is the first.

---

### M2 — Raw tier shadow path

**Discharges non-negotiables:** N2 (Replayable from raw — every webhook body lands in S3 before transformation), N5 (Webhook and backfill converge — webhooks write to the same `ingestion.raw` topic that backfill will use). Tests gated by 48-hour zero-divergence comparison establish the shadow-path correctness foundation N1 depends on at M5.

**Outcome:** the webhook router writes every received payload to S3 AND publishes to `ingestion.raw`, **in addition to** calling the existing inline `ingest()`. A no-op normalizer + writer pair consumes the topic but does NOT write observations (write path is feature-flagged off). Operationally invisible to users; ops sees S3 fills and Kafka consumer-group lag stays at zero.

**Changes:**
- `services/ingestion/raw_tier/s3.py` — `PutIfAbsent`, content-hash key builder, zstd compression.
- `services/ingestion/raw_tier/envelope.py` — Pydantic envelope model.
- `services/webhooks/router.py` — after signature verify + tenant resolve, AND BEFORE returning the inline response, write to S3 and publish to `ingestion.raw` with `ingress_kind="webhook"`. Wrap in try/except — shadow path failure must NOT break the inline response (which is the user-visible behavior during M2).
- `services/ingestion/normalizer/worker.py` — consume `ingestion.raw`, transform via handler registry, produce to `ingestion.normalized`. Writes only metrics, no observations.
- `services/ingestion/writers/observation_writer.py` (no-op mode) — consume `ingestion.normalized`, log a shadow-write event, do NOT INSERT.
- Discord Gateway worker — add same shadow write to S3 + Kafka after every dispatched `MESSAGE_CREATE` (still calls existing inline path).
- Gmail Pub/Sub endpoint — same shadow write (still triggers existing fetcher).

**Tests that must pass:**
- `test_webhook_shadow_path_writes_to_s3_and_kafka`: send a Slack webhook, assert observation written via inline path AND S3 object exists AND Kafka message produced.
- `test_normalizer_consumes_shadow_without_writing`: produce a synthetic envelope, assert normalizer produces to `ingestion.normalized`, assert no row in observations table.
- `test_envelope_schema_version_invariant`: round-trip envelope through Pydantic; assert field set stable.
- `test_shadow_path_failure_does_not_break_inline`: inject S3 timeout; assert inline observation still written; assert error logged + DLQ candidate created.

**Risk if deferred:** can't validate the data-plane shape under production traffic before flipping the writer on. This is the test bed for M3-M5.

**Risk of running out of order:** if M1 isn't done, no infra to write to.

---

### M3 — Embedding worker (decoupled)

**Discharges non-negotiables:** N1 (Never lose data — fixes the `embedding_pending=TRUE` orphan accumulation identified in Phase 1 Risk #6; without a worker, observations land in DB but stay invisible to retrieval). N3 partial (separate Kafka topic isolates embedding work from observation-write work; one cannot starve the other).

**Outcome:** the new Kafka-based embedding worker is live; new observations from the existing inline path get embedded via the new worker (the existing inline-embedding code is left in place, but the worker is the primary). The pre-existing `embedding_pending=TRUE` backlog gets backfilled by a one-shot script.

**Changes:**
- `services/ingestion/writers/embedding_worker.py` — full implementation per LLD §5.4.
- `services/ingestion/core.py` — modify to publish to `ingestion.embedding` after successful INSERT (parallel to the existing inline embedding attempt; both write `embedding_pending=FALSE` under guard).
- `services/ingestion/recovery/embedding_backlog.py` — full implementation per LLD §12.1.
- Diagnostic query (Block 2) run on staging → determines backlog size → determines whether script runs as one-shot or as a multi-day rate-limited job.

**Tests that must pass:**
- `test_embedding_worker_consumes_and_updates`: write observation with `embedding_pending=TRUE`, publish to topic, assert worker UPDATEs row.
- `test_embedding_worker_concurrent_with_inline_safe`: race the worker against the existing inline embedder on the same row; assert single UPDATE wins (guard clause).
- `test_embedding_backlog_script_idempotent`: run script twice on same DB; second pass UPDATEs nothing.
- `test_embedding_backlog_script_rate_limited`: assert script does not exceed configured QPS.

**Risk if deferred:** the orphan accumulation (Phase 1 risk #6) continues. Every observation in the meantime adds to the backlog.

**Risk of running out of order:** independent of M2 result; can ship after M1.

---

### M4 — Discord Gateway leader election + session persistence

**Discharges non-negotiables:** N1 (Never lose data — fixes the in-memory `session_id`/`seq` data-loss window identified in Phase 1 Risk #3). N3 partial (Redis lease prevents multi-pod IDENTIFY collisions; one pod's crash does not affect others).

**Outcome:** the Discord Gateway worker holds a Redis lease before establishing a WS session; on every dispatched frame, it UPSERTs `gateway_session_state`. On worker crash, the new leader reads the persisted `session_id`/`seq` and RESUMEs. Pod scale-up no longer doubles IDENTIFY traffic.

**Changes:**
- `services/integrations/discord/gateway/leader_lock.py` — new module: Redis-based lease with 30s TTL refreshed every 10s.
- `services/integrations/discord/gateway/client.py` — wrap the `run()` loop in `acquire_leader_lease`; on every dispatch, fire-and-forget UPSERT to `gateway_session_state`.
- `services/integrations/discord/gateway/state.py` — new helper: load/save `GatewaySessionState` against Postgres.
- `scripts/start.sh` — ensure exactly one Discord Gateway worker container per region (existing convention; documented).
- Test: deploy two pods, assert one acquires the lease and the other waits; kill the leader, assert the waiter takes over and RESUMEs from persisted `seq`.

**Tests that must pass:**
- `test_leader_lock_single_holder`: two competing workers; assert only one holds the lock at a time.
- `test_leader_lock_release_on_crash`: holder process killed; new holder acquires within ~lease TTL.
- `test_gateway_session_persist_and_resume`: simulate dispatch frames; assert `session_id` and `last_seq` UPSERTed; restart worker; assert next IDENTIFY uses RESUME with the persisted values.
- `test_gateway_no_data_loss_on_planned_restart`: write N frames, kill worker, restart, assert N frames are in observations (no gap).

**Risk if deferred:** Phase 1 risk #3 persists — worker crashes silently drop messages in the recovery window.

**Risk of running out of order:** independent of M2/M3; can ship in parallel with M3.

---

### M5 — Steady-state cutover (the riskiest milestone)

**Discharges non-negotiables:** N1 (cutover with observation UNIQUE protecting against double-ingest; circuit breaker auto-reverts under sustained lag → no data loss during regression), N3 (per-tenant cutover flag + circuit breaker means one tenant's lag cannot affect another's flag state), N5 (webhook path becomes the Kafka path; convergence at `ingestion.raw` becomes live). **This is the milestone where N1 transitions from "design property" to "tested property of the running system."** Pre-cutover gates listed below are the proof of N1; do not weaken them.

**Outcome:** for tenants with `ingestion.kafka_path_enabled=TRUE`, the webhook router writes to Kafka and returns 202; the inline `ingest()` is NOT called. The writer pool becomes the sole observation writer. The circuit breaker monitors lag and auto-flips the flag back on sustained breach.

**Pre-cutover gate (all must be true):**
1. M1-M4 complete and stable for ≥1 week in production.
2. Shadow-path observation counts (M2) match inline observation counts within 0.01% for ≥48 hours of sustained traffic.
3. Circuit breaker tested in staging: synthetic lag injected, flag flips, traffic reverts inline within 5 min.
4. Runbook `ops/runbooks/ingestion-cutover.md` reviewed and signed off.
5. Diagnostic queries (Block 2 + new ones) results in hand or explicit acknowledgment that proceeding without them is acceptable.
6. Product call on WS-latency tolerance answered → Mode A vs Mode A+B decision made (see §6 Q4).
7. **`services/ingestion/tests/test_ingest_core.py` is green in CI** — **Resolved** on branch `fix/test-ingest-core-ci`. The 15 FK-violation failures + 1 fixture-setup error were fixed by seeding the `tenants` row in the `tenant_id` fixture at [services/ingestion/tests/conftest.py:185-217](../../services/ingestion/tests/conftest.py#L185-L217) (commit `5ea5dc9`). A new CI workflow at [`.github/workflows/ingestion-tests.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ingestion-tests.yml) (commit `913572e` + scope narrowing in `bbf3031`) runs the suite on every push and PR to `integration/ingestion-hardening` and `main` under a non-superuser `fyralis_test` role (LOGIN, no SUPERUSER, no BYPASSRLS), so the project's RLS policies fire under test. First verification CI run: [26021692539](https://github.com/Fyralisinc/fyraliscore/actions/runs/26021692539) — 33 passed + 1 skipped (`test_real_ollama_embedding_stored` skips when `OLLAMA_URL` is unset, by design). Free win surfaced: `test_rls_policy_isolates_by_tenant` now PASSES in CI under `fyralis_test` (was previously only runnable manually). Original gate framing preserved: the shadow comparison measures count parity; count parity is not correctness parity; the legacy baseline now has the verified behavioural coverage the gate requires.
8. **Discord Gateway save-state ordering is durable against the broker-ack window** — **Resolved** on branch `fix/a6-broker-ack-ordering` (commit `269ce65` Phase 2 + `08c3b1f` Phase 3 + `4ddaf7f` Phase 3 follow-up). Option 1 chosen — per-frame `pre_save_flush(producer, timeout_seconds=2.0)` between the dispatch handler and the save-task creation. On flush failure (broad-scope: any Exception), the metric `discord_gateway_pre_save_flush_failures_total` increments, a warning is logged, and the save is skipped — the next worker re-processes the frame on RESUME under M2 dedup. The gateway worker's save-state is now durable against broker-not-yet-acked frames; verified by `test_no_frames_lost_across_sigkill` running against the extracted production function (no test-level workaround — the subprocess simulation imports the same `pre_save_flush` from [`services/integrations/discord/gateway/_durability.py`](../../services/integrations/discord/gateway/_durability.py) that production uses). See [`05-lld-amendments.md` §A6](05-lld-amendments.md), [`docs/decisions/a6-resolution.md`](../decisions/a6-resolution.md), and the operator runbook at [`docs/ingestion/m4-gateway-runbook.md`](m4-gateway-runbook.md). Original finding context preserved: M4 inherited the pre-M4 produce-return-on-local-enqueue gap; M5 made it operationally relevant by removing the inline fallback; this condition's resolution closes the gap before that cutover.

**Changes:**
- `services/ingestion/feature_flags/client.py` + `circuit_breaker.py` — full implementation per LLD §11.1 + §11.2.
- `services/ingestion/feature_flags/traffic_signal.py` — producer hooks in webhook router + FetchPage activity per LLD §11.3.
- `services/webhooks/router.py` — flag-branched: if `ingestion.kafka_path_enabled=TRUE`, skip inline `ingest()`, return 202 after Kafka publish.
- `services/ingestion/writers/observation_writer.py` (full mode) — flip from no-op to writing observations; calls into the existing `ingest()` via batched wrapper per LLD §5.2.
- Cutover plan: tier 1 (internal Fyralis test tenant) → tier 2 (volunteer customer) → tier 3 (10% of customers) → tier 4 (50%) → tier 5 (100%). Each tier flip is per-tenant via the `tenant_flags` table.

**Tests that must pass:**
- `test_writer_full_mode_produces_identical_observations`: shadow-comparison test — run 1000 webhooks; inline path's observation set must equal Kafka path's observation set (modulo UUIDs which are app-allocated).
- `test_writer_batched_insert_handles_unique_violations`: synthetic batch with duplicates; assert ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING preserves correctness; non-duplicate rows still inserted.
- `test_circuit_breaker_flips_flag_under_sustained_lag`: inject 60s+ lag for 5 min in staging; assert flag flips for affected tenants; assert webhook router reverts.
- `test_double_ingestion_safe`: race a webhook arriving during cutover (inline AND Kafka path); assert UNIQUE constraint catches the duplicate.
- `test_runbook_rollback_scenario_a_clean`: operator flips flag globally; in-flight Kafka drains; new traffic goes inline; assert no observations lost or duplicated.
- `test_runbook_rollback_scenario_b_per_tenant`: flip per-tenant; rest of traffic unaffected.

**Risk if deferred:** the entire backfill story (M6) depends on the cutover. Cannot ship backfill without the steady-state path being trustworthy.

**Risk of running out of order:** running M5 before M2's shadow-comparison has burned in is the single most dangerous sequencing mistake in this plan. The shadow comparison is the only mechanism that catches subtle handler-pipeline divergences before the writer becomes the sole source of truth.

---

### M6 — Backfill rollout per source

**Discharges non-negotiables:** N1 (cursor-data ordering invariant becomes a tested property; `test_advance_cursor_atomic_with_kafka_publish` is the gate), N4 (`feels_onboarded` content-based event becomes a user-facing reality; recency-first planning materializes), N3 (per-source planner + per-tenant rate buckets enforce isolation under backfill load).

**Outcome:** new installs trigger `TenantOnboardingWorkflow`; backfill runs to completion; reconciliation closes coverage gaps; `feels_onboarded` events fire; existing tenants get an opt-in "backfill now" admin action. Rollout per source in order: Gmail → GitHub → Slack → Discord.

**Pre-M6 gate:** M5 complete and stable for ≥2 weeks; circuit breaker has NOT auto-fired for any production tenant in that window.

**Changes per source** (each is a sub-milestone):
- M6.1 Gmail: `plan_shards_gmail`, `fetch_page_gmail`, `reconcile_gmail`. Migrate `gmail/fetcher.py` + `history_poller.py` + `watch_scheduler.py` to Temporal Schedules (the LLD names this as the most disruptive single change; allocate L effort).
- M6.2 GitHub: `plan_shards_github`, `fetch_page_github`, `reconcile_github`. Reuse existing `GithubClient` token-cache and chokepoint logic.
- M6.3 Slack: `plan_shards_slack`, `fetch_page_slack`, `reconcile_slack`.
- M6.4 Discord: `plan_shards_discord`, `fetch_page_discord`, `reconcile_discord` (with sparse 5% sampling).
- For each: per-source OAuth callback already writes the outbox row (from M5 changes); now the poller actually starts a workflow that does work.

**Common changes:**
- `services/ingestion/workflows/{tenant,source,shard,poller,monitor}.py` — full implementation per LLD §2.
- `services/ingestion/activities/` — all activities.
- `services/ingestion/reconciler/` — per-source count APIs.
- `services/ingestion/progress/publisher.py` + `events.py` — full Pydantic models + Kafka publisher.

**Tests that must pass (per source):**
- `test_planner_<source>_produces_expected_shards`: fixture install with known channel/repo/mailbox set; assert shard count and recency scores.
- `test_fetch_page_<source>_advances_cursor_atomically`: mock the API; assert cursor advances only after Kafka publish succeeds; assert mid-fetch crash re-runs from same cursor.
- `test_shard_fetch_workflow_resumes_after_worker_crash`: kill the worker mid-shard via Temporal test framework; assert workflow resumes and completes.
- `test_reconciler_detects_injected_gap`: pre-populate observations with a deliberate gap; run reconciler; assert reshared shard appears.
- `test_feels_onboarded_fires_when_window_filled`: full end-to-end pipeline with fixture; assert event published with content-based trigger.
- `test_oauth_outbox_to_workflow_end_to_end`: simulate OAuth callback; assert outbox row written, poller consumes within 5s, workflow starts, observations land.
- `test_end_to_end_small_tenant_backfill`: fixture tenant with 5 channels/repos/mailboxes; full backfill; assert coverage 100%.

**Risk if deferred:** the headline product gap (no backfill) persists.

**Risk of running out of order:** M6 before M5 means backfill writes go to a path that hasn't been validated against the steady-state path; divergences become bugs at install time.

---

### M7 (post-cutover refinements; not blocking the v1 cutover)

These are deferred but tracked here so they don't get lost.

- **Gmail unified canonicalize-in-writer-txn** (LLD §5.6) — ships behind `gmail.unified_canonicalization_enabled` flag; enable per-tenant after observed correctness matches.
- **Rate-limit-without-blocking-activity-slot** (LLD §3.1 future refinement) — change FetchPage step 1 to raise `RateLimited(retry_after_ms)` and let Temporal's retry policy reschedule.
- **`embedding_pending=TRUE` column deprecation** — replace with NULL check on `embedding` (LLD open Q4); deferred until embedding worker has been the sole writer for ≥1 month.
- **Per-tenant task queues opt-in** (LLD §2.4 / HLD edit 7) — add `tenants.task_queue_isolation_enabled BOOLEAN`; activate per-tenant for premium tier.
- **Mode B writer code deletion** — if the product call says "1-5s is fine for everyone," remove Mode B after one release cycle.

---

## 3. Critical path (must do first)

Five changes that must land before *anything* in §2's milestones can start. These are not milestones themselves; they are prerequisites.

1. **PgBouncer + `statement_cache_size=0`.** The writer pool's connection math is unsurvivable without pgbouncer. Asyncpg's default prepared statement cache is incompatible with transaction-mode pgbouncer; the codebase change is one line in `lib/shared/db.py` plus a sidecar/managed-service decision. Without this, M1 cannot ship: every other database-touching component assumes it.

2. **`entity_aliases_normalized_idx` functional index.** The batched alias lookup in the writer (LLD §5.2) is the source of the "~54 → ~7 queries per observation" claim. Without the functional index, batching makes large-tenant write latency worse than the current per-phrase pattern. Ship as migration 0049 inside M1; verify via EXPLAIN test before M5 cutover.

3. **New schemas (0045-0050).** Migrations are cheap to write but have a hidden ordering constraint: `onboarding_shards` references `onboarding_runs` which references `tenants`; `gateway_session_state` is standalone; `tenant_flags` references `tenants`. Apply in numerical order; the migration runner does this by convention but verify on staging.

4. **OAuth outbox + poller.** No workflow runs without a trigger. The OAuth callback changes (LLD §1.4.1) are the only mechanism that exists in this design for starting workflows from a user action. Without this, every other workflow piece is unreachable. The OAuth-callback transactional refactor is the work; the schema is trivial.

5. **Temporal cluster (Cloud or self-hosted decision).** Without Temporal, no workflows run. The decision (§6 Q2) is more about ops cost than functionality; resolve early so M1's worker registration code can be tested end-to-end against the real cluster.

**Order of critical-path delivery:** (3) and (5) are independent and can be done in parallel; (1) and (2) are also independent. (4) depends on (3) and (5). Critical-path duration ≈ max(M, M) ≈ ~2 weeks if no surprises.

## 4. Deliberate deferrals

Things that look like they belong in this plan but explicitly do NOT. Reasons attached so a future reader doesn't re-introduce them.

- **Multi-region active-active.** Single-region for v1; cross-region requires Temporal namespace federation, Kafka MirrorMaker, S3 cross-region replication. Each is a multi-quarter effort that buys nothing until a customer has a data-residency contract. Phase 5+.
- **Confluent Schema Registry / Avro / Protobuf.** Pydantic v2 + JSON in Kafka is sufficient. A registry adds a service to operate without solving a problem we have. Revisit if topics are ever consumed by code outside this monorepo.
- **Per-tenant Kafka clusters.** Partition affinity provides per-tenant isolation. Per-tenant clusters add operational complexity proportional to customer count for no isolation benefit beyond what we have.
- **Per-tenant Temporal namespaces.** Workflow IDs include `tenant_id`; Temporal serializes per-workflow-id and isolates per-workflow-history. Namespaces are for cluster-level tenancy (e.g., white-label Temporal access); we don't sell that.
- **Custom backpressure protocol.** Kafka consumer-group lag is the signal; the circuit breaker (LLD §11.2) is the response. No application-layer flow control.
- **Multi-shard Discord Gateway.** Single shard suffices below ~2,500 guilds per Discord's sharding rules. Implementing sharding now is YAGNI; defer until the per-shard guild count crosses the threshold.
- **Slack edits/deletes/reactions ingestion.** The current handler accepts `message` events with `text` only; backfill design depends on the handler shape, which is preserved. Adding event types is an orthogonal workstream (new `_EVENT_SHAPERS` entries, no substrate change).
- **GitHub event types beyond the existing six.** Same reasoning as Slack: orthogonal.
- **Gmail unified-canonicalization refactor.** Deferred to post-cutover M7. The interim three-transaction shape (current code) works; bundling the refactor with the cutover would obscure root-cause attribution if either breaks.
- **Embedding worker via `embedding_pending=TRUE` polling instead of Kafka.** Considered and rejected: Kafka topic is the steady-state signal for new work; the polling script (LLD §12.1) handles only the pre-cutover backlog. Two mechanisms for two distinct populations.
- **Rate limiter migration to a service mesh-level component** (e.g., Envoy filters). The Redis Lua bucket is fast, observable, and Python-side. Service-mesh integration is a deployment-architecture conversation, not a v1 design call.
- **Replacing the existing `ingest()` core function.** It's correct; preserve it. The writer wraps it (batched) rather than rewriting it.

## 6. Open questions / decisions needed

The final list before M1 starts. Each requires a named owner and a target date.

### Q1 — PgBouncer deployment mode

**Decision needed:** sidecar per pod vs centralised service.
**Owner:** Infra / SRE.
**Default if undecided:** sidecar (lower latency, less SPOF risk).
**Blocks:** M1.

### Q2 — Temporal Cloud vs self-hosted

**Decision needed:** Cloud (faster start, per-action billing) vs self-hosted (~$1.5k/mo infra + sustained SRE burden).
**Owner:** Engineering leadership.
**Recommended:** Cloud for v1 (LLD §11.2 already prefers it).
**Blocks:** M1.

### Q3 — Diagnostic queries (carried forward from Block 2 + Phase 3)

Four queries blocked on staging DB access:
1. Embedding backlog count (Block 2 corrected query, LLD §12.1).
2. Gmail Case A orphans (Block 2 corrected query, LLD §12.2).
3. Gmail Case B partial-provisioning detection (new from Phase 3 Q5, LLD §12.3).
4. Gmail NULL-`thread_canonical_id` rows (new from Phase 3 Q2, LLD §12.4).

**Owner:** whoever has staging psql access.
**Blocks:** sizing M3 (embedding backlog scope) and the M5 prereq (M5 gate condition #5 says results in hand OR explicit acknowledgment that proceeding without them is acceptable). Does not block M1 or M2.

### Q4 — WS dashboard latency tolerance (Phase 2.1 Q4)

**Decision needed:** is the cutover's regression from ~100ms inline to ~1-5s end-to-end acceptable for the WS-pushed dashboard at [services/realtime/dispatcher.py](services/realtime/dispatcher.py)?
- If **YES**: ship Mode A writer only; delete Mode B code after one release cycle (M7).
- If **NO**: ship Mode A + Mode B dual-mode writer; flip Mode B for WS-sensitive tenants via the per-tenant flag.

**Owner:** Product.
**Blocks:** M5 cutover decision; LLD §5.3 already specifies the dual-mode default; no architecture change either way.

### Q5 — SDK sandbox URL verification (LLD Bug 4, Phase 3 carry-forward)

**Decision needed:** before LLD §2.4's `asyncio.Semaphore`/`create_task`/`gather` pattern ships, hit the live Temporal Python SDK docs and confirm the cited section names are current.
**Owner:** the engineer implementing M1's workflow skeleton.
**Blocks:** nothing structurally; if the docs say otherwise, swap to Temporal-native primitives (`workflow.wait_condition`, etc.). Spike effort: <1 hour.

### Q6 — Kafka topic partition counts

**Decision needed:** the LLD picks 64 for `ingestion.raw` and `ingestion.normalized`, 16 for `ingestion.tenant_traffic_signal`, 16 for `onboarding.progress`. These are reasonable defaults; tuning requires measured per-source message rates.
**Owner:** SRE during M1.
**Default if undecided:** ship LLD numbers; revisit at first burst event.

### Q7 — Normalizer pool auto-scaler signal

**Decision needed:** scale out on lag > 60s; scale-in policy is "stay at peak for 1h after lag drops below 10s, then -1 pod every 15 min." Confirm or adjust.
**Owner:** SRE.
**Blocks:** M2 (no-op normalizer is one pod; M5 needs N).

### Q8 — Frontend update for Gmail response shape change

**Decision needed:** Gmail's `connect_finalize` response changes from `"provisioning": "started"` to `"provisioning": "queued"` (LLD §1.4.1 worked example). Frontend code consuming this string needs to update or accept both.
**Owner:** Frontend team.
**Blocks:** M5 (Gmail OAuth callback outbox shape ships here, since outbox is a critical-path piece).

### Q9 — Per-tenant task queue opt-in schema

**Decision needed:** add `tenants.task_queue_isolation_enabled BOOLEAN` now (anticipating premium tier) or defer until a premium tenant exists.
**Owner:** Engineering / product.
**Default if undecided:** defer (M7); current per-source default is fine for all v1 tenants.

### Q10 — Reconciliation interval for ongoing tenants

**Decision needed:** after a tenant's backfill completes, do we run reconciliation periodically (e.g., weekly) to catch silent drops? Or only on-demand?
**Owner:** Engineering.
**Default if undecided:** on-demand (operator action), not periodic. Periodic reconciliation is a Phase-5 maintenance loop, not v1.

---

**End of Phase 4.** The four-document set (`01-current-state.md`, `02-high-level-design.md`, `03-low-level-design.md`, `04-implementation-plan.md`) is now complete. M1 is the next concrete action — kick it off when critical-path Q1, Q2, and Q5 have named owners and target dates.
